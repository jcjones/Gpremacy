Requirements:

Mono 1.1.9 or later with Gtk# 2.4.0 or later. Gpremacy will run on any system on which Mono can run, including Windows 2000, XP, Solaris, Linux and Mac OS X.

Compiling:

You shouldn't need to. The distribution you received should have a bin/Debug or bin/Release directory with a .exe file. Look below at "Running the game". If you really want to compile the game, you will need a recent copy of MonoDevelop. Open the Gpremacy.mds file in MonoDevelop and hit Compile.

Running the game:

Gpremacy requires Mono be installed. If your computer has not caught Mono, visit http://go-mono.com/ .  Once you have momo, all you need to do is run the game executable with your mono environment. An example would be:
       
mono bin/Debug/gpremacy-mono.exe
